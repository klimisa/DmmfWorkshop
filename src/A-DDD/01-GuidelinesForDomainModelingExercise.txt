## Guidelines for Domain Modeling Exercise

In this part of the workshop, each team will pick a domain
and then collaborate on building a shared mental model and documenting the domain.

* One person takes the role of domain expert
* One person takes the role of main interviewer (although everyone can ask questions)
* One person documents the domain (although everyone can contribute)

The interviewer(s) will ask the domain expert questions in order to
understand the domain and become domain experts themselves.

The goal is to:
* Document the domain using AND and OR, etc
* And at the same time, develop a shared mental model
  and shared language among the group

Possible domains to use:
* ATM/Cash Machine
* Microwave oven
* Self-service espresso/cappuccino machine
* Delivery tracking service (e.g Fedex/DHL)
* Your own domain that you are an expert in



===================
How to interview
===================

* Never ask a yes/no question
* If you hear "it depends", drill deeper
* Disagreement between experts is OK.
  The design process is about getting everyone on the same page!

===================
How to model a domain
===================

* Start with the events and commands
* Pick one workflow to focus on.
  When that is done, do another one

===================
How to model a workflow
===================

* Ask what data is needed for the workflow input?
  * What data is from the event itself
  * What data is from the current state of the system
* What are the output events?
  For broadcast to downstream systems
* How does the state of the system change?
* What are the side effects?
  (Things that must be done but are internal to the domain)

====================
"Place order" Example
====================

Workflow: "Place order"
triggered by:
  OrderReceived
primary input:
  Order
other input/dependencies:
  ProductCatalog  // to lookup prices
output events:
  OrderPlaced
side-effects:
  An acknowledgment is sent to the customer,
  along with the placed order

---------------------------
Document the data with "AND"
---------------------------

data Order =
  CustomerInfo
  AND ShippingAddress
  AND BillingAddress
  AND list of OrderLines
  AND AmountToBill

data OrderLine =
  Product
  AND OrderQuantity
  AND Price

data CustomerInfo = CustomerName AND ContactInfo
data CustomerName = FirstName AND LastName

data BillingAddress = ??? // don't know yet



---------------------------
Document choices with OR
---------------------------

data OrderQuantity =
  UnitQuantity
  OR KilogramQuantity

data ContactInfo =
  EmailAddress
  OR PhoneNumber

---------------------------
Document simple/constrained types
---------------------------

data UnitQuantity = integer between 1 and ?
data KilogramQuantity = decimal between ? and ?

data EmailAddress = non empty string containing an @ symbol
data PhoneNumber = non empty string containing only digits, hyphens, and spaces
